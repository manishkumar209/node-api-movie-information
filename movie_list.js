    {
        review: "Thor: Ragnarok has been touted as the Thor trilogy, and it's not hard to see why. Taking over from Kenneth Branagh and Alan Taylor, Taika Waititi adds a touch of weird to the God of Thunder's adventures. Add Taika's unique, zany style to a fun story, fun characters, and plenty of action, and we've got a memorable conclusion to Thor's solo series."

    {
        review: "TThor ragnarok is a magnificent film that realises that Thor should be more than a 1 dimensional and boring character with personality, he should be fun and kinda goofy."
    },
    {
        review: "Ragnarok marks a pretty big shift in tone from the previous Thor movies, in that it takes itself far less seriously and pretty much plays everything for a laugh. The movie basically pokes fun at itself and pretty much every other MCU movie. In other words, it's a very meta movie. Even the characters don't really take anything seriously; they basically play it like it's nothing they haven't seen before, which is pretty much true."

    {
        review: "Thor is back and at his best!!\nBy far the best Thor film and by far the best we have seen of him in the MCU! "
    },
    {
        review: "Thor finds through the course of this  story, the ingredients of a successful superhero life are - family issues, old and new friends and monster demons to fight - combined with the courage and will to run towards life's problems. This charming underlying lesson makes it a winning addition to Marvel moviverse."
